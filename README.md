# FPGA Mastermind Game – CS303 Project

This project was developed as part of the CS303 Logic and Digital System Design course at Sabanci University.

## Project Description
A hardware-based implementation of the Mastermind game on FPGA. The system allows two players to interact using physical buttons and switches, with feedback displayed via LEDs and 7-segment displays.

## Features
- Finite State Machine (FSM) based game logic
- Button debouncing
- Timer and round control
- LED feedback system
- 7-segment display driver
- Two-player mode

## Technologies
- Verilog HDL
- FPGA (Gowin board)
- Digital logic design
- Finite State Machines
- Timing and clock division

## My Contributions
- Designed the main FSM architecture
- Implemented button debouncing logic
- Developed LED feedback logic
- Integrated 7-segment display controller
- Debugged timing and synchronization issues
